\chapter{Embedded Systems Are Omnipresent Yet Rarely Noticed}

Something in common between an oven, a car, and an NMRI machine is the ARM microprocessor that
these systems all share.

\section{Embedded System Goals}
Unlike desktop operating systems, which aim to present a flexible front-end to the user, embedded systems are highly
optimized for a specific task and may never interact with a user at all. Sometimes reliability and latency are prioritized over
all else, such as the system in ABS braking. In other embedded systems, such as hearing aids, low power consumption
may be the primary concern.




The odometry system in a car does not provide
a user interface for the driver to tweak it. In fact, it would be quite dangerous if it did do this. Instead, the odometry
system in a car is optimized for a very quick response time and for fault-tolerance
