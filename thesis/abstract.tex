Embedded systems are becoming increasingly complicated due to the emergence of
SOCs (system-on-a-chip) with multiple cores, dizzying amounts of peripherals, and
complicated virtual memory systems. Unfortunately, performant embedded systems
for these SOCs are still largely written from scratch in C because heavy
operating systems, such as Linux, can introduce more bugs and degrade real-time
performance.

This thesis proposes a new system called G.E.R.T, the Golang Embedded RunTime,
for multicore ARM processors.
GERT is a modified version of the Go runtime for
bare-metal operation on multicore ARMv7a SOC's in order to evaluate
the effectiveness of using a high-level, type-safe, and garbage collected
language for embedded applications. G.E.R.T
provides the multiprocessor support and basic memory abstractions of a
typical embedded toolkit while also enabling the user to leverage the language features
of Go in order to develop
concurrent embedded programs that are easier to reason about than similar ones
written in C.
