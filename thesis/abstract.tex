\section{abstract}

Embedded systems are becoming increasingly complicated due
to the emergence of SOC's (system-on-a-chip) with multiple cores, dizzying amounts of peripherals, and
complicated virtual memory systems that mirror that of x86. However,
performant embedded programs are still largely written from scratch in
C, which leads to constant re-implementation of the same subsystems. This wastes time and increases the likelihood of bugs.
Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS's) do exist but they impose their own
driver models and are also written in C, still increasing the likelyhood
of bugs.\par
  This thesis explores a system named G.E.R.T : a modified a version of the Go runtime intended to run
bare-metal on ARMv7a SOC's in order to evaluate
the effectiveness of using a high-level, type-safe, and garbage collected
language for embedded applications. G.E.R.T, the Golang Embedded RunTime,
provides the multiprocessor support and basic memory abstractions of a
typical RTOS while also freeing the user to leverage the language features
of Go in order to develop custom driver models and build more complicated
concurrent programs that are easier to reason about than similar ones
written in C.
