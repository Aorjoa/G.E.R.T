This is an interrupt throughput test. FPGA generates a single clock and simulataneously
delivers it to input pins. #simulataneous inputs goes with #of cores dedicated. The purpose
is to see how many events/sec a single core can handle and how it scales with more events+cores.

RESULTS:
           1 core/event    2 core/event      3 core/event      4 core/event
