This is a simple experiment which merely toggles a GPIO pin (GPIO3_27) as
fast as possible. In linux this is done with the sysfs API exposed by the kernel
to userspace.

summary:
GERT 127KHz <--> 180KHz
linux golang ~127Khz
linux C ~263KHz
GERT plan 9 assembly 568KHz

why:
Since gpio is MMIO, this is actually measuring the time
it takes to read/write memory

Questions:
1. Explain why Go is slower than C. Maybe a JTAG trace could help...
2. Explain the variance in Biscuit. A JTAG trace could help again...
