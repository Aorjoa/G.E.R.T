This tests the maximum interrupt frequency. I made some RTL which sends out
a predetermined amount of pulses at a variable frequency from my fpga. The job
of Biscuit is simply to count them and then I can see how many it misses.
10 pulses are sent

Results:
Biscuit : 135KHz <-> 161KHz (Missed 1 pulse at 161KHz)
