This tests the maximum interrupt frequency. I made some RTL which sends out
a predetermined amount of pulses at a variable frequency from my fpga. The job
of Biscuit is simply to count them and then I can see how many it misses.
10 pulses are sent

Results:
GERT ISR : 135KHz <-> 161KHz (Missed 1 pulse at 161KHz)

C Linux Polling : 156KHz <-> 161KHz (Missed 4 pulses at 161KHz)
C Linux ISR : How do without a kernel module ?

Go Linux Polling : 50KHz <-> 100KHz (Missed 10 pulses at 100KHz)
Go Linux ISR : May not be possible
